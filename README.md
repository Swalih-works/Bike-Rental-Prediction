# Bike Rental Demand Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts bike rental demand using machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to help bike-sharing systems maintain optimal bike availability based on environmental and temporal factors.

---

## Business Problem
Urban bike-sharing services require accurate demand forecasting to:

- Reduce waiting times  
- Improve bike distribution  
- Optimize operations  

This model predicts rental demand based on features like weather, season, and time-related variables.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:

- Weather conditions
- Seasonal information
- Date/time features
- Bike rental counts

---

## Project Workflow

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
